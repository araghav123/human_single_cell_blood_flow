This code is associated with the paper from Raghavendra et al., "Measurement of retinal blood flow precision in the human eye with multimodal adaptive optics imaging". BOE, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1364/BOE.524944. Made available here is an analysis pipeline for measuring single-cell velocity of blood cells from space-time images captured with an adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscope (AOSLO).
